# Ordenamiento_y_B-squeda
Console program, which combines bubble sort method and binary search method in Java.
In this project I use some concepts and skills that are usually considered as being part
of a basic Java knowledge: different data types, a boolean flag variable, desicion making 
structures (if ... else), loop control structures (for, while), and exception managing (try-catch).
